# Attention-Based-Image-Captioning In TFJS
### UCL Final Year Project

This project is referenced and rewrote from: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning

Some of the files(coco image data, the inception model and my current trained model) have not been uploaded due to the file size

The project pulled directly from this repo cannot run directly due to missing files

Will upload the whole project to online storage in the future, before that this repo is just for learning and referencing

### ðŸš§   In development  ðŸš§

The result will be updated on https://shadowhusky.cn/?app=Image_Captioning after finished (Under construction, will be available soon, you can test on http://101.133.222.235/?app=Image_Captioning which is the beta version )
